X-ray diffraction (XRD) on a Xenocs Xeuss 3.0 SAXS/WAXS instrument at ASU.  A GeniX3D Cu High Flux Very Long (HFVL) focus source was used to produce an 8 KeV Cu K alpha collimated X-ray beam with a wavelength of 1.541891 Ã… (generated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA). A windowless EIGER2 R 1M DECTRIS Hybrid pixel photon counting detector was used to collect the scattering signals at three sample-to-detector distances of 50 mm, 370 mm and 900 mm (denoted as WAXS, MAXS and SAXS in the Xeuss interface).
