# Raman of Nifedipine 
[Nifedipine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine) (NIF), sold under the brand name Procardia among others, is a calcium channel blocker medication used to manage angina and high blood pressure.
NIF is a yellow solid that melts around 173 C.  Raman was originally tried in June 2025, associated with the structural characterization of both [Nifedipine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifedipine) and [Felodipine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felodipine) (FEL). 
Raman in June 2025 was done using a 532 nm green laser and worked well for FEL, but the yellow color of NIF made doing the Raman of NIF basically NOT possible.  The reason for doing Raman of NIF and FEL is related to structural characterization of the liquid/glass (vs xtal) in collaboration with Dr. Chris Benmore (Argonne National Lab).
The primary characterization of the liquid/glass was done using high-energy XRD (Dr. Benmore at ANL-APS). The yargerlab at ASU also followed up the XRD characterization with ssNMR, IR, Raman, microscope, and DSC.

The XRD of NIF indicates NO2 intermolecular interactions and we are hoping to confirm or refute the hypothesis of NO2 interactions and vibrational spectroscopy is the most directly informative.
Hence, we ran ATR-IR of NIF and FEL in June 2025 (both before and after ssNMR). However, as mentioned above the Raman of NIF was not possible with a visible laser (532 nm). 
So, here in October 2025 we are trying again to collect the Raman spectrum of NIF in both the crystalline and amorphous state, but this time we switched to the 785 nmr laser.
The hope is that we can avoid laser induced fluorescence and/or laser adsorption that prevents good Raman spectra to be collected on this yellow solid.

In the Raman done here (Oct 10, 2025 - 2025_10_10):
* Laser at 784 nm and powers between 25 uW and 250 mW in Unpolarized, Polarized and Depolerized.
* Spectrometer used was a [Andor Kymera 328](https://andor.oxinst.com/products/kymera-and-shamrock-spectrographs/kymera-328i) with a 600 groove/mm grating and an [Andor DU420A-BEX2-DD](https://andor.oxinst.com/assets/uploads/products/andor/documents/andor-idus-420-specifications.pdf) (26x26 um pixels, 256x1024) detector.
* Dectector cooled to -95C and generally use a 50X Mit lens.
